    "A database is a software application used to store and organize structured or unstructured data. It allows users to access, manage, and update information quickly and efficiently. A database can be thought of as a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two main types of databases that differ in their architecture, data models, and design principles. Here are the key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, which means that data is stored in tables with defined columns and rows. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a variety of data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query language: SQL databases use SQL, a language specifically designed for working with relational databases. NoSQL databases have their own query languages, which may not be as standardized as SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means that they can handle large volumes of data by adding more nodes to a cluster. SQL databases are traditionally more difficult to scale out, but modern relational databases like PostgreSQL have made strides in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data consistency: SQL databases are ACID-compliant, which means that they ensure data consistency, even in the face of failures or concurrent access. NoSQL databases often sacrifice some level of consistency for scalability."

    " DDL stands for \"Data Definition Language\" and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define the structure of a database and its objects. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects like tables, views, indexes, and stored procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of four commonly used DDL statements and their purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table or a view. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"employees\" with columns for the employee's ID, name, and department:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "   id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "   department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete a database object, such as a table or a view. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the \"employees\" table that was created in the previous example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, you can use ALTER to add a new column to an existing table, change the data type of a column, or rename a table. Here's an example of using ALTER to add a new column to the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10,2);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table, but keep the table structure intact. This is different from using the DELETE statement, which removes individual rows from a table. TRUNCATE is useful when you want to start fresh with a table, but don't want to delete and recreate it. Here's an example of using TRUNCATE to remove all data from the \"employees\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects like tables, views, and stored procedures. The CREATE statement is used to create new objects, the DROP statement is used to delete objects, the ALTER statement is used to modify objects, and the TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping the table structure intact.

    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new data into a table. It specifies the table name, followed by a list of columns and the values to be inserted into those columns. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO customers (id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'shivam', 'shivamtiwari@gmail.com');\n",
    "This command would insert a new row into the \"customers\" table with the ID of 1, the name \"shivam\", and the email address \"shivamtiwari@gmail.com\".\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. It specifies the table name, followed by the column to be updated and the new value. It can also include a WHERE clause to update only specific rows. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE customers SET name = 'rahul' WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "This command would update the \"name\" column of the row with an ID of 1 in the \"customers\" table to \"rahul\".\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees;\n",
    "In this example, the SELECT command retrieves all the data from the \"employees\" table. The \"*\" symbol is used to indicate that all columns from the table should be returned. If we wanted to retrieve only specific columns, we could list them after the SELECT command, like this:\n",

    "   Primary key and foreign key are both important concepts in relational database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It can be a single column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies a record in a table. A primary key must be unique, not null, and should never change over time. The primary key is used to link the records in one table to the records in another table, and it is used as a reference point for any foreign key relationships in other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table called \"employees,\" the primary key could be the employee ID number. This number should be unique for each employee and should never change. This primary key can be used to link the employee record to other tables, such as a \"salaries\" table or a \"departments\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a field in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to link two tables together and create a relationship between them. A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. A foreign key relationship is used to enforce referential integrity between the linked tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a \"salaries\" table, there might be a field called \"employee ID,\" which refers to the primary key of the \"employees\" table. This foreign key relationship ensures that all salaries are associated with a valid employee record. If a salary record tries to reference an employee ID that doesn't exist in the \"employees\" table, the database will reject the record and enforce the referential integrity of the relationship.\n",
